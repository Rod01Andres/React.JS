# React.JS
I´m starting a new path in platzi, now studying frontend with React.JS, in my actual work I use Angular.JS, but i´d like to expand my knowledge in other frameworks.

## Initial Commit
I´ve copied a basic project configuration from platzi´s github, for now, the objective is to learn the basic components of react, then, I´ll do a project since nothing.
